# Critical Review

This command provides objective, third-person critical analysis of your documents, summaries, or plans.

**Usage**: Provide the content you want reviewed (CLAUDE.md summaries, requirements, plans, etc.) or specify the file/section to review.

I will switch to an objective third-person perspective and provide:

## Critical Analysis Framework

1. **Clarity and Completeness**
   - Are the points clearly expressed?
   - What important details are missing?
   - Are there ambiguous statements?

2. **Logical Consistency**
   - Do the ideas flow logically?
   - Are there contradictions or conflicts?
   - Do conclusions follow from premises?

3. **Practical Feasibility**
   - Are the proposals realistic?
   - What implementation challenges exist?
   - Are resource requirements considered?

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - What assumptions are unstated?
   - What edge cases are overlooked?
   - What dependencies are missing?

5. **Improvement Recommendations**
   - Concrete suggestions for enhancement
   - Alternative approaches to consider
   - Areas requiring further investigation

**Note**: This review will be honest and direct, without flattery, focusing on constructive criticism and improvement opportunities.
