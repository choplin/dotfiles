# Name Project

This command helps you find the perfect name for your project by considering its core value and checking for conflicts.

**Usage**: Describe your project - what it does, its purpose, target users, and key features.

I will:

## 1. Value Analysis

- Identify the core value and purpose of your project
- Understand target audience and use cases
- Extract key characteristics and differentiators

## 2. Name Generation Strategy

- **Single word**: Use wordplay, puns, or creative variations to avoid conflicts
- **Two words**: Combine complementary concepts for clarity and uniqueness
- Focus on simple, representative names that aren't too direct

## 3. Conflict Checking

- Search existing projects, domains, and trademarks
- Check GitHub repositories and package registries
- Verify social media handle availability
- Ensure no major naming conflicts

## 4. Candidate Presentation

For each name candidate, I'll provide:

- The underlying concept and wordplay
- Why it represents your project's value
- Conflict check results
- Availability assessment

Please describe your project and I'll help you find the perfect name:
