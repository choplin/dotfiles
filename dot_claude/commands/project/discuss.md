# Discuss Together

This command enables deep discussion mode where I focus solely on exploring ideas through dialogue without taking any implementation actions.

**Usage**: Present your fuzzy idea, concept, or problem that you want to explore through discussion.

I will:

## Discussion Approach

1. **Active Listening**

   - Carefully understand your explanation
   - Ask for clarification when needed
   - Reflect back what I understand

2. **Critical Questions**

   - Challenge assumptions constructively
   - Explore edge cases and implications
   - Identify potential risks or issues
   - Question the "why" behind decisions

3. **Idea Development**

   - Propose alternative approaches
   - Build on your ideas with enhancements
   - Connect concepts to broader patterns
   - Suggest concrete examples

4. **Collaborative Exploration**
   - Think together through problems
   - Consider multiple perspectives
   - Weigh trade-offs openly
   - Explore "what if" scenarios

## Discussion Goals

- **Clarify fuzzy ideas** into concrete concepts
- **Make informed decisions** about next actions
- **Create clear summaries** of our conclusions
- **Identify actionable next steps**

**Important**: During this discussion, I will:

- NOT implement any code or make changes
- NOT use file manipulation tools
- Focus entirely on conceptual exploration
- Help you think through ideas thoroughly

Please share the idea, concept, or problem you'd like to discuss:
